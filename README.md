# Welcome to ChronOS!
ChronOS is an operating system written from scratch in C and Assembly.
This is a hobby project of mine to better understand computer science and operating system fundamentals at the very core level.<br>
However, I'm open to having this evolve as a small toy-OS that other people in the community can contribute to or learn from for their own specific use-cases.<br>
So contributions and support are absolutely welcome!

This project is inspired by MIT PDOS's RISC-V implementation of XV-6 and at this stage is basically a re-implementation of that system.<br>
So massive, massive thanks go to them!
